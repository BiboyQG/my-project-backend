# SpringBoot + SpringSecurity + JWT

About this repo:

This is my personal backend repo using SpringBoot + SpringSecurity + JWT + Redis(as cache) + RabbitMQ(dealing with message queue).

You can start the backend directly in IntelliJ IDEA. But before that, please set the Environment variable as follow:
```
SPRING_AMQP_DESERIALIZATION_TRUST_ALL=true
```
Then you are all set and good to go!
